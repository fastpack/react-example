The small React application including [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [redux-saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga).

To run it locally, first install [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/).

You can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) on MacOS as following:

```bash
brew update
brew install watchman
```

On Ubuntu you can build it from sources as described in [this post](https://medium.com/@vonchristian/how-to-setup-watchman-on-ubuntu-16-04-53196cc0227c).

Finally, run:

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

Have fun!
